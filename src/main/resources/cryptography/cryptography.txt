Cryptography Overview
---------------------

Cryptography is the science and practice of secure communication. It includes techniques to protect information from unauthorized access or alteration.

It covers:

Encryption and Decryption: Ensuring confidentiality by transforming data into an unreadable form and reversing it with the correct key.

Digital Signatures: Verifying the authenticity of data.

Hashing: Ensuring integrity by creating fixed-size digests of data.

Key Exchange Protocols: Securely exchanging cryptographic keys over untrusted channels.

Cryptography also encompasses various algorithms, protocols, and frameworks for both data confidentiality (e.g., AES, RSA) and authentication and integrity (e.g., SHA-256, HMAC).

Conclusion
The term cryptography serves as the broad umbrella covering all aspects of secure data transmission, including encryption, decryption, signatures, and more.
